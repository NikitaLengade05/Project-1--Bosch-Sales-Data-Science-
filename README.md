# Data-Science-with-Python-Bosch-Stores-Sales-Prediction-Project
***Purpose:***
The purpose of this project is to analyze retail sales data from Bosch stores and identify trends, patterns, and factors affecting weekly sales. By leveraging data analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques, the study aims to provide insights into store performance, the impact of external factors like fuel prices and unemployment, and predictive models for sales forecasting.

***Problem Statement:***
Retail businesses often face challenges in understanding sales fluctuations and their influencing factors. This analysis seeks to address key questions:

Which store has the highest and most variable sales?
How do external factors like CPI, fuel prices, and unemployment impact weekly sales?
What is the sales growth rate of different stores over time?
Can a predictive model accurately forecast weekly sales?

***Solution:***
To address these challenges, the following methodologies were implemented:

***Data Exploration & Cleaning:*** The dataset was loaded, inspected for missing values, and formatted appropriately.
Descriptive Analytics: Basic statistics and visualizations were generated to understand the sales trends across stores and different time periods.

***Hypothesis Testing:*** Statistical tests were conducted to examine the relationship between weekly sales and external factors such as fuel prices, unemployment rates, and CPI.

***Machine Learning Model:*** A Linear Regression model was developed using key independent variables to predict weekly sales. Model accuracy was evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

***Conclusion:***
The analysis revealed that Store 20 had the highest weekly sales, while Store 14 exhibited the most significant variation. The results of hypothesis testing indicated a strong correlation between CPI, fuel prices, and sales performance. The linear regression model achieved a prediction accuracy of 93.05%, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting sales. These insights can help Bosch optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and store performance evaluation, ultimately driving better business decisions
